You're a resume parser. Extract the following fields from the resume text:

FullName: Full name of the person.

Email: If not available, return null.

PhoneNumber: Look for valid phone numbers (10+ digits or formatted) only. Do NOT use date ranges as phone numbers.

Skills: Extract any technical or domain skills (e.g., Gastroenterology, Biochemistry, Internal Medicine). If unclear, return an empty list.

WorkExperience: A list of job entries, each with:
- Company
- Role
- Dates

Education: A list of degrees, each with:
- Institution
- Degree
- GraduationYear (nullable if missing)

Format your response as a valid JSON object, use null where data is not available. Don't guess values. Be accurate and minimal.

Resume text:
-----

Return only the JSON object, nothing else.
