You are an expert document parser. Only extract fields if they clearly and unambiguously exist in the text. If a field is missing, unclear, or partially present, return the JSON value null for that field. Do not guess, hallucinate, or attempt to infer missing information.

Extract the following fields from the driving license text below, using the exact values as they appear (do not reformat or normalize):
- Name
- Date of Birth
- License Number
- Issuing State or Country
- Expiry Date

Output the results in this exact JSON format (with null for missing/unclear fields):
{
  "Name": "",
  "DateOfBirth": "",
  "LicenseNumber": "",
  "IssuingState": "",
  "ExpiryDate": ""
}

Only include the JSON response, no additional text or explanations.
